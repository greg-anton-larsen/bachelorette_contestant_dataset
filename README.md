# Bachelorette Contestant Dataset
I gathered data about all contestants from The Bachelorette (U.S.) from Wikipedia and packed them into a SQLITE3 database.

# What's in the Dataset
- season - Which season the contestant was featured in.
- name - The contestant's full name.
- age - The contestant's listed age from the show.
- hometown - The contestant's hometown, as listed on the show.
- occupation - The contestant's occupation, as listed on the show.
- outcome - What happened with the contestant - usually the week they were eliminated.
- place - What place the contestant finished in. All ties are rounded up, so all the men who were eliminated in a single Rose Ceremony were all given the same finishing place.
